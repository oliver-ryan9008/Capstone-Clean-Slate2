# Capstone-Clean-Slate2

This was my final project at devCodeCamp in Milwaukee, WI. It was a solo project that I decided the premise and developed from beginning to end. It is still an ever-changing work in progress. On this project I used HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Popper.js, C#, and built the project in ASP.NET MVC 5 with Entity Framework in Visual Studio 2017.

The idea behind the project was to build a payroll software that allows admins to update employee hours worked, add commissionable sales, taxes, and approve/deny day off requests made by employees.

As stated before, this is a continuing project, and as such I am continuing to add more features as time allows. One of the next things on the agenda is functionality for admins to be able to add schedules for employees and for those employees to be able to view their schedule in addition to making specific scheduling requests.

Feel free to ask any questions you may have about functionality! Thank you for checking it out!
